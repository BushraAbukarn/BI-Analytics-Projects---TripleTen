## üìå Purpose
This externship project was designed to strengthen data analysis and visualization skills by working collaboratively with a real-world Airline Booking dataset. The primary goal was to formulate business-relevant questions and answer them using SQL for data extraction and Tableau for visual storytelling. Each team member independently explored one key question‚Äîranging from identifying marketing factors influencing customer preferences, analyzing high-demand flight routes, to examining how flight durations impact purchase behavior‚Äîwhile contributing to a cohesive analytical narrative.

üß™ Analysis & Methodology
We utilized SQL to compute descriptive statistics for flight duration. The flights ranged from 4.7 to 9.5 hours, with an average of 7.3 hours.
Based on these insights, we created a new column called flight_length, categorizing flights into short, medium, and long groups for deeper analysis.
We then exported the cleaned dataset to Tableau, where we developed a side-by-side bar chart to visualize the average requests for meals and preferred seats across different flight length categories.

## üí° Recommendations

**Recommendations for marketing:**
1. Launch targeted bundled flight upgrade promotions such as in-flight meals/preferred seating for Australia and Malaysia since they contribute to the highest upgrades.
2. Monday and Sunday are the highest booking days therefore schedule email campaigns, social media promotions, and retargeting ads to launch on Sundays and peak on Mondays for customers to plan their advance trips and maximize promotional reach
3. Single customers and couples contribute the most to advanced bookings therefore design marketing campaigns specifically for these groups (solo travel deals, romantic getaways) since this is the highest demand
   - Couples prefer to fly on Mondays and Wednesdays and preferred flight times are 8AM, 9AM, 12PM
   - Singles prefer to fly on Mondays and Tuesdays and preferred flight times are 7AM, 8AM, 12PM

**Recommendations for flight route focused growth:**
1. Double-down on digital campaigns for AKL-KUL and DMK-KIX, using dynamic web offers and retargeting to squeeze even more value from the already strong Internet channel.
2. Refresh the mobile booking flow with faster checkout and push-only promos, aiming to lift mobile's share on high-volume routes and close the gap on lower-performing ones.
3. Run route-specific incentives for ICN-SIN, MEL-SGN and PEN-TPE to spark interest and nudge these mid-tier routes closer to the leaders.

## üõ∫ The Zuber Database
### üìãProject Description
Zuber, a new ride-sharing company launching in Chicago, aims to understand passenger preferences and evaluate how external factors influence ride patterns. I plan to achieve this by performing a series of analytical tasks using SQL queries.


## üìä SQL Tasks

### 1. Company Ride Counts (Nov 15‚Äì16, 2017)
- Retrieve the number of taxi rides per company.
- Output: `company_name`, `trips_amount`
- Filter by date: **November 15‚Äì16, 2017**
- Sort by `trips_amount` in **descending** order.

---

### 2. Rides by "Yellow" or "Blue" Taxi Companies (Nov 1‚Äì7, 2017)
- Count the number of rides for companies whose names contain **"Yellow"** or **"Blue"**.
- Output: `company_name`, `trips_amount`
- Filter by date: **November 1‚Äì7, 2017**
- Group results by `company_name`.

---

### 3. Top Companies vs. Others (Nov 1‚Äì7, 2017)
- Identify the number of rides for:
  - **Flash Cab**
  - **Taxi Affiliation Services**
  - Group all **other companies** under `"Other"`
- Output: `company`, `trips_amount`
- Filter by date: **November 1‚Äì7, 2017**
- Group by company name and sort by `trips_amount` in **descending** order.

---

### 4. Neighborhood Identifiers
- Retrieve the identifiers of the **O'Hare** and **Loop** neighborhoods from the `neighborhoods` table.
- Output: `neighborhood_name`, `neighborhood_id`

---

### 5. Hourly Weather Conditions Classification
- From the `weather_records` table, classify weather as:
  - `"Bad"` if the `description` contains `"rain"` or `"storm"`
  - `"Good"` otherwise
- Use the `CASE` operator for classification.
- Output: `date`, `hour (ts)`, `weather_conditions`

---

### 6. Loop to O'Hare Rides on Saturdays with Weather Info
- From the `trips` table, retrieve rides that:
  - **Start in the Loop** (`pickup_location_id = 50`)
  - **End at O‚ÄôHare** (`dropoff_location_id = 63`)
  - Occur on **Saturdays**
- Join with weather data using the classification from Task 5.
- Output:
  - `ride_id`
  - `pickup_time`
  - `duration`
  - `weather_conditions`
- Exclude rides with **missing weather data**.

---

## üõ† Tools Used
- SQL (PostgreSQL syntax)
- PostgreSQL database
- Jupyter Notebook (optional for running queries interactively)

---

## ‚úÖ Outcome
This analysis will help Zuber:
- Understand company popularity trends
- Assess customer behavior in relation to weather and time
- Make informed operational decisions before launching in Chicago

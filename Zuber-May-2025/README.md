## üõ∫ The Zuber Database
### üìãProject Description
Zuber, a new ride-sharing company launching in Chicago, aims to understand passenger preferences and evaluate how external factors influence ride patterns. I plan to achieve this by performing a series of analytical tasks using SQL queries.

## üóÇÔ∏è Database Schema
The Zuber database contains 4 different datasets:

### Neighborhoods Table: data on city neighborhoods
- `neighborhood_id`: Unique identifier for each neighborhood
- `name`: Name of the neighborhood

### Cabs Table: data on taxis
- `cab_id`: Unique identifier for each cab (vehicle code)
- `vehicle_id`: The vehicle's technical ID
- `company_name`: The company that owns the vehicle

### Trips Table: data on rides
- `trip_id`: Unique identifier for each ride (ride code)
- `cab_id`: Code of the vehicle operating the ride
- `start_ts`: Date and time of the beginning of the ride (rounded to the hour)
- `end_ts`: Date and time of the end of the ride (rounded to the hour)
- `duration_seconds`: Ride duration in seconds
- `distance_miles`: Ride distance in miles
- `pickup_location_id`: Pickup neighborhood code
- `dropoff_location_id`: Dropoff neighborhood code

### Weather Records Table: data on weather
- `record_id`: Weather record code
- `ts`: Record date and time (rounded to the hour)
- `temperature`: Temperature when the record was taken
- `description`: Brief description of weather conditions, e.g. "light rain" or "scattered clouds"

---

### 5. Hourly Weather Conditions Classification
- From the `weather_records` table, classify weather as:
  - `"Bad"` if the `description` contains `"rain"` or `"storm"`
  - `"Good"` otherwise
- Use the `CASE` operator for classification.

### 6. Loop to O'Hare Rides on Saturdays with Weather Info
- From the `trips` table, retrieve rides that:
  - **Start in the Loop** (`pickup_location_id = 50`)
  - **End at O‚ÄôHare** (`dropoff_location_id = 63`)
  - Occur on **Saturdays**
- Join with weather data using the classification from Task 5.
- Exclude rides with **missing weather data**.

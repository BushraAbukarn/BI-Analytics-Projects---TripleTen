## ✨Manhattan Vacation Rental Market
## 🎯 Executive Summary
This analysis aims to evaluate the Manhattan vacation rental market to identify the most promising property types for investment. Specifically, we seek to answer the following questions: 
- Which neighborhoods and property size (i.e., number of bedrooms) are most attractive for vacation rentals?
- Also, how much revenue have these listings generated? 
### Assumpitions 
1. The listings data includes several variables; utilizing the number_of_reviews_ltm column can help assess the attractiveness of each listing. Also, analyzing the number of bedrooms helps determine which rental types are most popular.
2. Using the calendar data, we can estimate the revenue generated by the most attractive listings by analyzing the adjusted_price and available columns.
## 📊 Dataset Description
This project is based on two raw datasets containing Airbnb listing information. Although the original data included a broad range of variables, only a selected subset was used for analysis to align with the project objectives.
### Raw Data 1 – Listing Details
- `id`: Unique identifier for each listing  
- `neighborhood`, `neighborhood_clean`, `neighborhood_group`: Geographic details about the listing location  
- `room_type`: Type of room offered (e.g., Entire home/apt, Private room)  
- `bathrooms`, `bathrooms_text`: Number and type of bathrooms  
- `bedrooms`, `bedrooms_clean`: Number of bedrooms  
- `beds`: Number of beds  
- `number_of_reviews`, `number_of_reviews_ltm`: Total and recent reviews  

### Raw Data 2 – Availability & Pricing
- `listing_id`: Reference to the listing ID  
- `date`: Calendar date for availability  
- `available`: Availability status for the given date  
- `price`, `adjusted_price`: Daily price and adjusted price of the listing  
- `minimum_nights`, `maximum_nights`: Booking restrictions for stay duration  


## 🧪 Analysis & Methodology
1. Cleaned raw data: hide unnecessary columns, standardized the neighborhood values using TRIM() and PROPER() functions; stored in a new column:  nighborhood_clean, and cleaned the bedrooms column by replacing empty space with 0 using IF() function.
2. A new column called revenue earned was added to the calendar data. if the property was booked, revenue_earned is set to the adjusted price; otherwise, it's set to $0.
3. In the listings data, added a new column also called revenue using SUMIF to pull in total earnings from the 30-day calendar data matching the listing ID.
4. Created the following pivot tables: Total Number of Reviews by Neighborhood, Number of Listings by Bedroom Count, and Total Revenue by Listing ID.
